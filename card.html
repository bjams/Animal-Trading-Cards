			<p>Moose (male) can be identified by their open-hand shaped antlers.
			   Moose typically inhabit boreal forests and temperate broadleaf 
			   and mixed forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates.
			   Unlike most other deer species, moose do not form herds and are solitary animals, 
			   aside from calves who remain with their mother until the cow begins estrus 
			   (typically at 18 months after birth of the calf), at which point the cow chases away young bulls.
